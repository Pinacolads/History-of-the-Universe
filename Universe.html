                    <p>You’ve been randomly chosen to learn the secrets of the universe.

                        but you’ve been chosen to learn about the terrifying history of the universe that we live in!

                    <h3>Laws of the Universe</h3>
                    <p>Before we delve into the super complex history of the universe, we’re going to talk about the basic concepts you need to understand. 
                        Think of it as the confusing appetizer before the even more confusing main course.  
                    </p>
                    <p>The universe is constantly progressing towards a state of pure entropy. Sounds spooky huh? Well, it is. 
                        Entropy is essentially a measure of chaos, the randomness of how molecules interact are moved around. 
                        For example, the entropy of a solid is low since the molecules are at a fixed point. However, for gases it’s a whole other story.  
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <figcaption style= "position: relative; left: 160px;">It's entropy city up in here!</figcaption>
                    <br>
                    <p>The universe is also bound by the laws of thermodynamics. These laws are complicated and have the capability to make a grown man cry, 
                        but we’ve dumbed it down for you so it’s easier to understand.  
                    </p>
                    <p>(Edit: Only two laws are important to understanding the universe, but we’ve already put too much effort into it. Be grateful.)</p>
                    <p>0th law: If objects with different temperatures interact with each other, they will reach thermal equilibrium. Sounds complicated right? 
                        Well, this law is basically just defining a thermometer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>1st law: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, rather it’s converted to another state. Sometimes it’s converted into energy that cannot be used properly, 
                        but we don’t really know that for sure, do we? (Entropy Alert)  
                    </p>
                    <p>2nd law: The entropy of the universe always increases, trust me that’s a bad thing. For example, when you have a hot cup of tea, the heat gets released into the surrounding.
                        Sure, the energy was technically transferred to another state but, we can’t really do anything with it can we? Now let’s think about it to a universal scale and you’ll get an idea of how bad our situation is, 
                        and the worst part? We can’t do anything about it.  
                    </p>
                    <p>3rd law: So, the second law was kind of a mood killer, but this law offers a glimmer of hope. It states that the entropy of a substance at absolute zero (0 Kelvin) is also zero. In other words:  </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 id="ugh">Super cold = No entropy = No heat death of the universe! It's that easy! &#129321;</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>That’s all nice and everything but turns out it’s impossible for us to get everything to be that cold since it’s impossible to get to zero Kelvin. 
                        Yeah, that glimmer of hope we mentioned earlier was a lie. Sorry about that. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The universe also gets a little weird when it comes to gravity. Our sources say that some guy named Albert Einstein developed a theory known as “General Relativity” which basically says that space-time bends around mass.</p>

                    <h3>Pre-Big Bang™</h3>
                    <p>Ah, it seems like 14 billion years ago was just yesterday. Back when the universe was a singularity, which basically means that all matter was densely packed into the smallest point. 
                        The good old days. The universe was extremely hot to the point where we didn’t even know what was going on, but the best part is that since all matter was tightly packed into one singular point, 
                        that meant that there wasn’t a lot of entropy. Then everything changed when there was a Big Bang™, which caused a sudden release of matter and energy.  
                    </p>

                    <dl>[Time: 10^-43  seconds, Temperature: HOT]
                        <dt>Ok, after the big kaboom, the universe expanded extremely quickly in a fraction of a second, increasing from the size of an atom to the size of a grapefruit, in that instant.</dt>
                        <br>

                        <figcaption style= "position: relative; left: 550px;">This was the size of the universe, we promise.</figcaption>

                    <dl>[Time: 10^-32  seconds, Temperature: 10^27ºC]
                        <dt>A little after the inflation, the universe has some new additions to it. Subatomic particles, such as quarks, and electrons, now exist. But the universe is still too hot for them to do anything cool, 
                            so they sadly float around as hot universe soup. 
                        </dt>

                    <dl>[Time: 10^-6  seconds, Temperature: 10^13ºC]
                        <dt>As the universe is expanding, it gradually starts to cool down, and now it’s finally cooled down to the point where quarks can clump together to form protons and neutrons. </dt>

                        <dt>The universe slightly cooled down enough for protons and neutrons to form into hydrogen and helium nuclei, but it’s still too hot for electrons to orbit them. The universe is going through puberty 
                            and it’s starting to go through its weird, awkward stage where it’s super dark and foggy. We all have that stage, except society calls it “the emo phase” but what they don’t understand is that it isn’t a phase. &#128420;
                        </dt>

                        <dt>Yeesh, that phase lasted way longer than it should’ve. The universe finally cooled down enough to finally have electrons orbiting all the hydrogen and helium nuclei, and we finally have the atoms we know and love. 
                            With their hallowed presence blessing the universe, the atoms said, “Let there be light!”

                        <dt>Now that the universe has stars, they can switch things up by adding more variety by creating heavier elements such as aluminum, iron and nickel. This is also when the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) was 
                            created.

                        <dt>This is around the time where some stars start to die and spew out heavy elements. Eventually these elements form new stars and planets. Have enough of those and you have something like the Solar System. Wow, what a journey huh? </dt>

                    <h3>The Evidence</h3>
                    <p>Now, you might be thinking that there’s not really proof about this “Big Bang” thing being a real thing. “There’s a reason why it's called the Big Bang Theory &#9757; &#129299;” you may say aloud. Unfortunately for you, 
                        there’s evidence proving this theory. When you look at galaxies, they look like they’re moving away from us and looks “redder” than it’s supposed to, due to the Doppler effect.
                    </p>
                    <img id="nyoom" src="redshift.jpg">
                    <p>You can also thank good ol’ Edwin Hubble for looking at the light from galaxies and measuring its redshift and discovering that the further away the galaxy is, the faster it's traveling (Hubble’s Law, baby). Also, remember your old pal, CMB?
                        Well, turns out that the radiation that it left is proof of the Big Bang™, because the light from the Big Bang™ has been traveling through the universe, which proves that it's expanding.
